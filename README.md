# My HTML Homework

This is my daily HTML homework project. I’m learning basic HTML and practicing how to create simple web pages.

## Files in this project:

- `index.html` – Main webpage
- `style.css` – Styling (if added)
- Other files will be added as I learn more

## What I learned

- How to use basic HTML tags
- Creating forms, buttons, and links
- How to structure a webpage

I will keep updating this project every day after completing my homework.

Thanks for checking it out!
